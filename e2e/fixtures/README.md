# E2E Test Fixtures

This directory contains fixtures and test data for End-to-End (E2E) tests.

## Purpose

- Store mock data files (JSON, etc.) for E2E tests
- Provide reusable test data configurations
- Maintain consistent test data across E2E test suites

## Usage

Fixtures can be loaded in E2E tests using standard file I/O or Playwright's data management features.

## Future

As E2E tests are added, this directory will be populated with:
- Mock API response data
- Test user credentials and profiles
- Sample bot configurations
- Test conversation data
